Load the necessary packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(leaps)
library(olsrr)
library(caret)
library(class)
```

Read in the data 
```{r}
msrp <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmlam1/MSDS-Projects/main/Applied%20Stats%20Project%201/Vehicle_MSRP.csv', show_col_types=F)
```

Study the data and clean variable names
```{r}
dim(msrp) # 16 variables, 11914 observations
str(msrp) # or spec(msrp) for condensed recap
summary(msrp)
janitor::clean_names(msrp)
```

Check for missing values for each variable
```{r}
cbind(lapply(lapply(msrp, is.na), sum))

#engine fuel type: 3
#engine HP: 69
#engine cylinders: 30 
#Number of doors: 6

unique(msrp$`Engine Fuel Type`) # remove ?
unique(msrp$`Engine HP`) # continuous so use median for model or year for NA?
unique(msrp$`Engine Cylinders`) # set as categorical, merge 0 and NA together?
unique(msrp$`Number of Doors`) # google car and input value

```
Confirm that there are zero NA values
```{r}
sum(as.numeric(is.na.data.frame(msrp)))
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
